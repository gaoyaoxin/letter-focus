# Letter Focus
A beautiful, distraction free web writer built to help you [#WriteWithFocus](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23WriteWithFocus).


## About
Out of the flurry of ugly digital writing surfaces arose LETTER FOCUS, to save us all! So... I made this simple web writer so people like myself could enjoy the time they spend writing. There's a bit more to come, but Letter Focus is almost complete!
