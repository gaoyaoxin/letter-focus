# Letter Focus
A beautiful, distraction free web writer built to help you [#WriteWithFocus](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23WriteWithFocus).


## About
I got tired of ugly digital writing surfaces, and good options cost money... So I made this simple web app so people could enjoy the time they spend writing.
